        <p>We recommend you study the theoretical materials before you rent the
      time on Spot so that you have a plan of action for your lesson and can
      complete it successfully.</p>

        <p>The robot is located in our laboratory in Silicon Valley. The course is self-paced, you select one hour-long session to practice with the robot by Google Calendar after paying for it. We donâ€™t charge for anything else. Once you feel ready, you buy a 1 hour-long practice session specifying your access credentials (SSH key) and the time when you want to connect to Spot to solve the task.</p>

      <section class="layout-narrow">
        <h2>3. Practice your skills</h2>
        <p>When your session starts, you can connect to the Spot robot by SSH and join a Google Meet meeting to watch the robot by the camera. While working, use our lessons presented in Robonomics Academy and Spot documentation at dev.bostondynamics.com</p>

        <h2>4. Share</h2>
        <p>The robot captures its state. And after the lesson, MerkleBot signs the robot state records to prove its origin for the certificate and you can download it.</p>
        <p>Share your results in your social accounts. You may even add your successful lessons results as a certificate in your LinkedIn profile: just choose Merklebot as an Issuing organization and blockchain hash of lesson's certificate as an Credentials ID.</p>
